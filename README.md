Congratulations!
You've found the treasure chest. Now, how on earth do you open it?

# ðŸ”‘ Installing Rider
I *highly* recommend downloading and installing Rider. It is far better than Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code, especially for Unity development. It also makes addressing any issues easier and quicker.

1. Create a JetBrains account and register for an educational license [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students).
2. Download JetBrains Rider [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/).
3. Open Rider, click on "Configure" > "Settings" > "Appearance & Behaviour" > "New UI"
4. Close Rider

# ðŸ§¬ Cloning the GitHub repository
1. Open up Rider again & follow [this guide](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/rider/Cloning_repository.html).

# ðŸ“‚ Opening the project in Unity
1. If, when the cloned project opens, you can see a Unity logo located at the top next to the run button, click it and select "Open Unity". I recommend using this technique every time you open the project, otherwise you must open either application manually.
2. If you don't see the Unity logo, just open up the Unity editor from Unity Hub. **Make sure to open in the same version, `2021.3.13f`.**

# ðŸ¤‘ Profit
Congratulations! You are winner!
You're now ready to begin contributing to the project.
