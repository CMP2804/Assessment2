# Branching
Each issue should be associated with its own branch
Each branch should be given a relevant yet concise name. It doesn't have to be the associated issue's title.
For example, an issue implementing enemies titled "Add enemy characters" could be associated with a branch called `enemy_characters`.
Branch names should use `snake_case`.

# Unit Testing
Each function you write should have unit tests associated with it.
You can find a video by Code Infallible on the topic.

# Committing & Pull Requests
At the start of each working day, make sure to pull from the GitHub repository.
At the end of each working day, make sure to push to the GitHub repository.

# Code Styles
For simplicity, follow [standard C# coding conventions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions). 
This should be enforced by JetBrains Rider by default.
Make sure to properly namespace your files. This should also be enforced by Rider.
